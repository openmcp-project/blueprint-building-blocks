| providerConfigs.helmCrossplane | list | [] | creates k8s manifest `kind: ProviderConfig` of `apiVersion: helm.crossplane.io/v1beta1` This `ProviderConfig` typically points to k8s secret in which a `kubeconfig` of K8s Service Account or SAP Gardener Shoot Cluster Admin Kubeconfig Request `kind: AdminKubeconfigRequest` of `apiVersion: gardener.orchestrate.cloud.sap/v1alpha1` is stored. The `ProviderConfig` is required to manage `Helm Charts` installations on a k8s cluster such as [`kind: ProviderConfig`](../crossplane-provider-helm/templates/helm-release.yaml) of `apiVersion: helm.crossplane.io/v1beta1` . |
| providerConfigs.helmCrossplane[0].credentials.secretRef | object | [] | A SecretRef is a reference to a secret key that contains the credentials that must be used to connect to the provider. |

See Cloud Orchestrator [SAP Gardener Setup](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-orchestration/docs/sap-services/gardener/provider#gardener-providerconfig). |
| providerConfigs.kubernetesCrossplane[0].credentials.secretRef | object | [] | A SecretRef is a reference to a secret key that contains the credentials that must be used to connect to the provider. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound | list | [] | creates k8s manifest [`kind: ProviderConfig`](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-vault/v1.0.0/resources/vault.upbound.io/ProviderConfig/v1beta1) of `vault.upbound.io/v1beta1`. Additional information see [GCP Quickstart](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/provider-gcp/#create-a-providerconfig). |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec | object | [] | A [ProviderConfigSpec]((https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-vault/v1.0.0/resources/vault.upbound.io/ProviderConfig/v1beta1)) defines the desired state of a ProviderConfig. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec.address | string | `""` | Required origin URL of the Vault server. This is a URL with a scheme, a hostname and a port but with no path. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec.credentials | object | [] | Credentials required to authenticate to this provider. There are many options to authenticate. They include - token - (Optional) Vault token that will be used by Terraform to authenticate. May be set via the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable. If none is otherwise supplied, Terraform will attempt to read it from ~/.vault-token (where the vault command stores its current token). Terraform will issue itself a new token that is a child of the one given, with a short TTL to limit the exposure of any requested secrets, unless skip_child_token is set to true (see below). Note that the given token must have the update capability on the auth/token/create path in Vault in order to create child tokens. A token is required for the provider. A token can explicitly set via token argument, alternatively a token can be dynamically set via an auth_login* block. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec.credentials.secretRef | object | [] | A SecretRef is a reference to a secret key that contains the credentials that must be used to connect to the provider. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec.namespace | string | `"ns1"` | Set the namespace to use. |
| providerConfigs.vaultUpbound[0].spec.skip_child_token | string | `nil` | Set this to true to disable creation of an intermediate ephemeral Vault token for Terraform to use. Enabling this is strongly discouraged since it increases the potential for a renewable Vault token being exposed in clear text. Only change this setting when the provided token cannot be permitted to create child tokens and there is no risk of exposure from the output of Terraform. |
| secrets[0].data | list | [] | *(optional)* [data](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/secret-v1/) *(map[string][]byte)* Data contains the secret data. Each key must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.'. The serialized form of the secret data is a base64 encoded string, representing the arbitrary (possibly non-string) data value here. Described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4 |
| secrets[0].name | string | `""` | defines k8s `metadata.name` value of `kind: Secret` |
| secrets[0].namespace | string | `"ns1"` | *(optional)* defines k8s [`metadata.namespace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/object-meta/#ObjectMeta) value of `kind: Secret` |
| secrets[0].stringData | list | [] | *(optional)* [stringData](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/secret-v1/) *(map[string]string)* allows specifying non-binary secret data in string form. It is provided as a write-only input field for convenience. All keys and values are merged into the data field on write, overwriting any existing values. The stringData field is never output when reading from the API. |
